Description: Python version manager
 pyenv is a Python version manager, like what nvm is for Node.js. It is able
 to build, install, uninstall, and otherwise manage versions of Python on top
 what is already available in the distro's package manager. This includes
 distros like PyPy and Anaconda alongside the canonical CPython.
