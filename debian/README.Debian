pyenv for Debian

Th Debian package for pyenv is mostly identical to upstream; the important directories are installed to /usr/share/pyenv, and the main executable is symlinked to from libexec/pyenv.

The tests (only present in the build process) have been sensibly modified to either pass or skip them, and the Makefile has proper install targets, etc added too.

Additional post-inst/post-rm scripts have been written to provide (and remove) suitable shell integrations, much like a typical user install that upstream recommends.
